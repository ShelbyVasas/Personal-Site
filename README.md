# Web Pages

This is currently just one page under the domain shelbyvasas.com but as I create more projects, they will be added as sub domains. This site is server side rendered and calls a public joke api as you can see in the side drawer overlay.

# Development Environment

This Web App was written using React in JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. Many of the UI components were created by incorporating DaisyUI.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work
